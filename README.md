# Minimum Wage Analysis in the United States using Apache Spark 

This Big data analysis project aimed at providing comprehensive insights into minimum wage dynamics across different states and over time. Leveraging Apache Spark and Scala, this project offers a robust framework for processing and analyzing minimum wage data extracted from diverse sources.

Pipeline: 
1. Data Processing: The project utilizes Apache Spark to efficiently process large volumes of minimum wage data.
2. Mean Wage Computation: FairWage computes the mean minimum wage by state, offering insights into regional variations.
3. Inflation Analysis: Analyzing inflation rates allows for understanding the real purchasing power of minimum wages.
4. Comparison with DOL Data: FairWage compares minimum wage data with Department of Labor (DOL) reported wages, providing validation and additional context.
5. State-Level Insights: Users can delve into state-specific trends and variations in minimum wage policies and their impacts.
